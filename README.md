# Rust-Hello-World-ToolKit-with-Generative-AI
Welcome to the **Rust Hello World Toolkit**, created as part of the Moringa AI Capstone Project. This guide helps beginners learn Rust programming with the support of Generative AI tools.

---

##  Project Overview

This is a simple, beginner-friendly "Hello World" application built with **Rust**. The goal is to learn a new programming language by leveraging AI to:
- Understand syntax and structure
- Set up a working Rust environment
- Compile and run basic Rust code
- Document the entire process for others to follow

---

##  Why Rust?

Rust is a modern, fast, and memory-safe systems programming language. It’s a great alternative to C/C++ with a growing developer community. It’s also used in WebAssembly, embedded systems, and blockchain projects.
